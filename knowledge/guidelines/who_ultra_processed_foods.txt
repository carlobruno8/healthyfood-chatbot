AUTHORITY:
World Health Organization (international public health authority)

TOPIC:
Ultra-processed foods

CLAIM:
High consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with poorer diet quality
and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases.

RATIONALE:
Ultra-processed foods are typically high in free sugars, saturated fats, and sodium,
while being low in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
Frequent consumption displaces healthier whole foods in the diet.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Limit intake of packaged snacks, sweets, and ready-made meals
- Prefer minimally processed foods such as vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fish
- Use cooking methods based on fresh ingredients when possible

LIMITATIONS:
This guidance is population-based and does not assess individual metabolic or medical conditions.
