AUTHORITY:
World Health Organization (international public health authority)

TOPIC:
Beverages, alcohol, and sugary drinks

CLAIM:
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol should be limited
as part of a healthy diet.

RATIONALE:
Sugar-sweetened beverages provide large amounts of free sugars with little
nutritional value and are associated with weight gain and increased risk of
noncommunicable diseases.
Alcohol consumption contributes excess energy intake and is associated with
multiple health risks, including liver disease and cardiovascular conditions.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Prefer water, unsweetened tea, or coffee without added sugar as primary beverages
- Limit fruit juice intake and prioritize whole fruits instead
- Treat alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine as occasional rather than daily choices

LIMITATIONS:
This guidance is population-based and does not provide individualized recommendations
regarding alcohol tolerance or medical conditions.
