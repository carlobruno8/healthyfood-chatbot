TOPIC:
Mediterranean dietary pattern

CLAIM:
Higher adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with reduced risk
of cardiovascular disease, overall mortality, and metabolic disorders.

RATIONALE:
The Mediterranean diet emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes,
nuts, olive oil as the main fat source, moderate fish intake, and limited
consumption of red meat and ultra-processed foods.
This pattern provides a favorable balance of fiber, healthy fats, and micronutrients.

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
- Base meals around vegetables, legumes, and whole grains
- Use olive oil as the primary fat for cooking and dressing
- Consume fish regularly and limit red and processed meats
- Treat sweets and ultra-processed foods as occasional foods

LIMITATIONS:
The Mediterranean diet is a flexible dietary pattern and may vary across
regions and cultures.
